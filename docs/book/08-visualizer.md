# 08 – Visualizer Tour (Breakpoints and Traces)

Open `visualizer.py` and you’ll get:
- Program picker and speed slider
- Memory list with PC arrow (→) and breakpoint markers (●)
- Registers A/B/C with colors and mini TritWord view
- Tabs: Ternary Logic, Conceptual Transistor, Disassembly
- Last instruction label and A‑timeline

Tips:
- Double‑click a memory row to toggle a breakpoint.
- Run/Pause toggles execution; stopping on breakpoints.
- The logic tab is a safe sandbox to build intuition.
