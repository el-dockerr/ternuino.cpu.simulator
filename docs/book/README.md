# The Ternuino Book

A friendly, hands-on introduction to ternary (base‑3) computing using the Ternuino CPU simulator.

This guide is designed for absolute beginners. You’ll learn the ideas behind ternary numbers and logic, how the tiny Ternuino CPU works, how to write small assembly programs, and how to visualize programs running on the hardware visualizer.

If you can add and subtract and are curious, you’re ready!

## Who is this for?
- Curious makers and students
- Educators looking for an approachable multi-valued logic demo
- Devs who want to try a different way to think about computing

## What you’ll learn
- What ternary digits (trits) are: −1, 0, +1
- Balanced ternary numbers and why they’re symmetric and fun
- Ternary logic (TAND, TOR, TNOT) and “three‑way” thinking
- The Ternuino CPU: registers, memory, instructions
- Assembly programming with labels and branches
- Live visualization with the included GUI

## Getting started
- Prerequisites: Clang Compiler, Windows/macOS/Linux
- Clone the repo, then see `README.md` how to build.
- Alternatively you can download the Binaries on Github



Pick any program from the dropdown and press Load, then Step or Run. Double‑click memory lines to set breakpoints. Watch A/B/C and the A‑timeline change.
